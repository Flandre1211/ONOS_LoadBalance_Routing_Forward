## Update Note

2018.05.15 Update and release 1.1 to adapt ONOS **1.14.0-SNAPSHOT** version.

2017.03.28 Build, run and test. All pass. Release 1.0 for ONOS **1.9.0-SNAPSHOT** version.

.

## Instruction to Compile

1. Embed me with ONOS codebase
2. Modify the **modules.defs** file in the ONOS_ROOT, refer to **modules.defs__available_example** file
3. Build whole ONOS by onos-buck.
   (You can use my utility script for ONOS: https://github.com/MaoJianwei/SDN_Scripts/blob/master/ONOS/autoONOS.sh)

I provide pom.xml for importing this project to Intellij IDEA or other IDE by maven, but you **should NOT** use maven to compile me, and maven may fail.

.
