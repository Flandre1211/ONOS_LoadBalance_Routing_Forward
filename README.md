## Update Note

2018.05.15 Update to adapt ONOS **1.14.0-SNAPSHOT** version, from ONOS **1.9.0-SNAPSHOT**


## Instruction to Compile

> 1. Embed me with ONOS codebase
> 2. Modify the **modules.defs** file in the ONOS_ROOT, refer to **modules.defs__available_example** file
> 3. Build whole ONOS by onos-buck.
>    (You can use my utility script for ONOS: https://github.com/MaoJianwei/SDN_Scripts/blob/master/ONOS/autoONOS.sh)

I provide pom.xml for importing this project to Intellij IDEA or other IDE by maven, but You **should NOT** use maven to compile me, and maven may fail.


## Backward Compatibility

If you use ONOS around 1.9.0-SNAPSHOT version, you can checkout to this commit history:
